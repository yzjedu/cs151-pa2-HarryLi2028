* This code was stressing me out. There was a lot of brainstorming and mapping out everything without functions which I didn't use because I was almost done with the code. I was able to create many nested while loops and if statements and have a better understanding of them. The code started to give me problems when the nested while loop didn't work properly until I realized it was just a simple mistake. overall the testing part helped me a lot through the errors and planning saved me a lot of time but also cost me a lot of time when I forgot something to input into the code.
